# 'Bristol Charity Coffee Collective (B3C)' Website

For my first project I decided to create a website for a fictional collective of independent coffee shops in Bristol.  Their unique selling point would be that they donate 20% of all profits from each sale to local charities.  Bristol is very near to my home, and has a great community spirit, along with a lovely independent food and coffee scene.  I was also inspired by local charities for the homeless.

I decided that as I am limited to HTML and CSS, that I would avoid creating any kind of online store or membership program, and stick to advertising the business.
 
## UX
 
My fictional brief involved the business looking to improve their web presence in an effort to entice people to:

1. Visit their shops
2. Gain a greater understanding of their ethos
3. Improve customer interaction by providing multiple methods of contact

Aside from the obvious requirement of a 'landing' page (which I felt should have a full screen hero image and inviting navigation links), I wanted to create an online sample food and drinks menu, a page detailing the location of each shop, and an about page with information about the collective.  Finally I wanted to include a contact form.

I approached the design utilising the following user stories:

1. As a customer I need to be able to locate my closest shop
2. As a customer I need to be able to view a sample menu
3. As a customer I need to be able to contact the business
4. As a customer I need to be able to view the site on mobile devices, tablets, laptops and desktops

5. As the proprietor I need to increase awareness of my business and drive sales to facilitate charitable donations
6. As the proprietor I need to improve understanding of our charitable efforts amongst our customer base to generate opportunities for outreach
7. As the proprietor I need to provide additional contact points for our customers to drive active customer feedback

### Wireframes

I originally created my wireframes on paper, then recreated them in Balsamiq, which I have exported to /Wireframes/MP1-B3C-Wireframes.pdf

### Differences between the Wireframes and Final Design

The 'Inspiring Quote' on index.html, was replaced with information regarding the 20% charity donation from each sale, and membership of the [Suspended Coffees](https://www.suspendedcoffees.com/) movement.  This was also moved from being offset and right aligned at large breakpoints, to simply being centered on all breakpoints.  I made these changes late during the build process, as I felt that the charity information was more relevant, and that the centered design simply looked better.  I had originally planned for the site to have a second quote on the about.html page.  The original homepage quote was reused here instead.

## Features

1. Fully responsive mobile first design allows users to view the site on mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop with design considerations for screen widths from 280px (Galaxy Fold) up to full 4k screens.
2. Welcoming images and text encourage users to explore the site
3. Menu carousel allows the display of food and drink menus without excessive scrolling
4. Tooltips on icons on the Locations page allow users to understand the available facilities at each shop
5. Contact modals for each shop allow users to tap/click to call the store directly, or open a new email
6. Directions button for each shop allow users to tap/click to open a google map in a new tab with directions from their current location (assuming active location services) to the selected shop
7. Contact Us modal + form allows users to submit a name, email address and comments
 
### Existing Features

I believe that I have met the needs of each of the User Story requirements within the confines of HTML and CSS:

1. As a customer I need to be able to locate my closest shop
	- locations.html provides the address for each shop, and a button which links to directions to the shop in google maps.
	- This could be improved by including a post code search, or a current location search, but these are outside the scope of the project.

    <br><img src="/README-Images/UserStory1.png">
	
2. As a customer I need to be able to view a sample menu
	- menu.html provides sample food and drink menus

    <br><img src="/README-Images/UserStory2.png">
	
3. As a customer I need to be able to contact the business / As the proprietor I need to provide additional contact points for our customers to drive active customer feedback
	- Each page provides access to the 'Contact Us' modal via links in the header and footer.
	- Additionally, locations.html provides a modal for each location that includes functional email and tel links
	
    <br><img src="/README-Images/UserStory3.png"><img src="/README-Images/UserStory7.png">

4. As a customer I need to be able to view the site on mobile devices, tablets, laptops and desktops
	- Each page is fully responsive between 280px wide to 4k+
	
5. As the proprietor I need to increase awareness of my business and drive sales to facilitate charitable donations
	- The site has a modern design, and includes plenty of indexible text
	- Images are served via img tags rather than background-images to ensure that they are also indexed

    <br><img src="/README-Images/UserStory5.png">

6. As the proprietor I need to improve understanding of our charitable efforts amongst our customer base to generate opportunities for outreach
	- index.html clearly states that the business donates 20% of each purchase to charity, and that they are members of Suspended Coffees.
	- about.html describes how the business makes it's donations in more detail, and encourages customers to report charitable endeavours for considerations

    <br><img src="/README-Images/UserStory6.png">

### Features Left to Implement

1. Validation Feedback Messages:
	- I did not have time available to implement validation feedback messages, opting for a simple red border/exclamation response for failure and green border/tick for validated entries.  With more time I would like to implement screen reader enabled descriptive responses.
2. Postcode Search:
	- I would like to implement a postcode based search and/or current location based search, (accessible via Locations.html and the Footer on each page), to enable users to locate and obtain directions to the closest shop.  (I do not believe that this can be accomplished without at least JS and a JSON so was not suitable for this project).
3. Membership:
	- I would like to implement a membership scheme, with user login and points based reward system for purchases etc.  This would not be possible at this stage of my course as it would require far greater back-end functionality.

## Technologies Used

The project is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/), and was developed using the [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) IDE.

Once the CSS files were complete, they were processed by [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) to add browser vendor prefixes

Images (sans Favicon and Logo) were processed by [TinyJPG](https://tinyjpg.com/) to reduce image sizes and improve loading times

The project was built using: 

* [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5/)
* [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
	
Contact Form Validation is provided by a sample [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/forms/#validation).  This approach allows for screen reader interaction with validation feedback.

### Notable Challenge

Due to wanting to avoid overlapping media queries wherever possible, it was difficult to ensure that CTA Images did not exceed the height of the screen (in landscape) on certain devices.  The only way to achieve the desired result was to sparingly include some height restrictions.  Of my 19 media queries, only 3 are based on a combination of width+height.  The rest rely soley on width.  I believe I could solve this issue more appropriately once I have learned and am able to include JavaScript.

## Deployment

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following method:
1. Open the [Code Institute Gitpod Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template/)
2. Click [Use this template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template/generate/)
3. Provide a Name
4. Provide a Description
5. Choose Public
6. Click 'Create Repository from template'.  GitHub will create the repository and open it.
7. Click 'Settings'
8. Scroll down to 'GitHub Pages'
9. Change Source from 'none' to 'master' and click 'Save'
	
The project was developed using [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/).  There are no differences between the developed and deployed versions.
	
Running the code locally would involve installing a webhost, downloading the latest [commit](https://github.com/BWeeks101/MP1-B3C/archive/master.zip), then extracting that zip to an appropriate folder to be hosted by the local webhost.
There are far too many potential applications and configurations to list them here in detail.  The site contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so should not be complex to host, however I would recommend sticking to the hosted site on [Github Pages](https://bweeks101.github.io/MP1-B3C/).

## Credits

### Content

Much of the menu text was copied from various coffee shop websites, such as
* [Coffee #1](https://www.coffee1.co.uk/menu/)
* [Cafe Nero](https://caffenero.com/uk/menu/coffee/)
* [Starbucks](https://www.starbucks.co.uk/menu)
* [Costa](https://www.costa.co.uk/menu/)
		
All additional text was written from scratch by myself.

### Code
		
During creation of the project, I utilised the following resources to gather example code, then modify it for usage on this site:

* CI 'WhiskeyDrop' project (rgba overlay)
* CI 'Resume' project (Form)
* [Bootstrap Navbar Toggler](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/navbar/#toggler)
* [Bootstrap Grid System](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/layout/grid/#how-it-works)
* [Bootstrap Carousel](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/carousel/) with [Controls](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/carousel/#with-controls/) and [Indicators](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/carousel/#with-indicators/)
* [Bootstrap Live Demo Modal](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/modal/#live-demo/)
		
Rather than rely on in browser form validation (I was not happy with the default response), I utilised the following:
* [Bootstrap Sample Form Validation JavaScript](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/forms/#validation)

		// Example starter JavaScript for disabling form submissions if there are invalid fields
		(function() {
		  'use strict';
		  window.addEventListener('load', function() {
			// Fetch all the forms we want to apply custom Bootstrap validation styles to
			var forms = document.getElementsByClassName('needs-validation');
			// Loop over them and prevent submission
			var validation = Array.prototype.filter.call(forms, function(form) {
			  form.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
				if (form.checkValidity() === false) {
				  event.preventDefault();
				  event.stopPropagation();
				}
				form.classList.add('was-validated');
			  }, false);
			});
		  }, false);
		})();
						
* NB: GitPod returned a warning with this script, as the 'validation' variable is created, but never read.
	- As this variable is unnecessary for my project, I adjusted line 8 from:
					
			var forms = document.getElementsByClassName('needs-validation');
								
	- to:
								
			document.getElementsByClassName('needs-validation');
							
* Rather than embed the script directly within each html page, I created and included /scripts/bootstrap-form-validation.js

	*It is almost impossible to search for any coding related issue online without encountering Stack Overflow links towards the top of the results.  Whilst I certainly read Stack Overflow when researching solutions to challenges, I have not (to the best of my recollection or per my notes) utilised any code directly, in whole or in part.
